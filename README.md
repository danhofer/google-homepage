This is a simple mock-up of the Google homepage to learn the basics of HTML and CSS.

I took advantage of Google Chrome Dev Tools and began using Git from the command line.

This exercise came from the Odin Project's [curriculum](http://www.theodinproject.com/web-development-101/html-css)

This was fun to build, and I enjoyed using Dev Tools to tweak the CSS. If I had more time, I would continue with styling the hover links and working on a mock-up of the search results page.
