This is a simple mock-up of the Google homepage to learn the basics of HTML and CSS.

I took advantage of Google Chrome DevTools and began using Git from the command line.

This exercise came from the Odin Project's [curriculum](http://www.theodinproject.com/web-development-101/html-css).

This was fun to build, and I enjoyed using DevTools to tweak the CSS. I went a little beyond the exercise's requirements by adding :hover and :active styling, which make the mock-up feel more complete to me.
